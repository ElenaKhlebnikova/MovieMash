# üçøMovieMash

Welcome to MovieMash repository! This is a web-application which allows users to view different movies, tv-shows, see their rating, production, cast, crew and popularity.
It also allows users to view actors and producers' biography, filmography and their popularity.

Here is the [preview link](https://startling-travesseiro-2774de.netlify.app/).

The project is using [The Movie Database](https://developer.themoviedb.org) API.

## üìñWhat I have learnt

1. Using React Router v6.11 to implement navigation between different pages.
2. Using React Query to fetch data using multiple queries.
3. Using The Movie Database which requires token authentication.
4. How to work with different endpoints provided by The Movie Database.
5. How to build features in smaller PRs and avoid pushing to main.
6. How to use RTL to write integration tests that span multiple components.
7. How to use Tailwind to build responsive UI much faster.
8. Improved CSS skills.
9. How to work with env variables locally (.env files) and on deployment platform (Netlify).

## üò≠ What I struggled with

1. Using React Query for the first time mainly because their documentation was confusing at first.
2. Building complicated filtering functionality for "Explore Movies" and "Explore TV shows" pages.
3. Although the biggest part of the project is built using Tailwind, custom CSS was still required to animate the slider component and build [rating range](https://i.ibb.co/W6bTXGW/image.png) component when exploring movies or TV shows.
